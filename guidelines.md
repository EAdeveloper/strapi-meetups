## Community Guidelines

Strapi meetups bring together people who are interested in Strapi and the JAMstack ecosystem at large. We are very grateful for your contributions to the open-source project and really value in-person knowledge sharing, collaboration, and mentorship. 

Here is a set of guidelines to ensure we form a respected and professional group for the Strapi and JAMstack ecosystem:

- Promote and support inclusivity, respect, and professionalism in the tech community.  
- Strive to keep the group active with frequent meetups and presentations on relevant content (including the latest Strapi releases and new Strapi projects or use cases). If you can no longer commit to being an active community leader, please give us a heads up so that we can help out.
- Ensure that all participants can freely and openly share ideas in a safe and welcoming environment that encourages mutual respect and collaboration.
- Keep up-to-date on the latest technological advances in Strapi and the ecosystem.
- Be respectful when mentioning other vendors, technologies, and communities in the ecosystem.
- Select content that is educational, accurate, and free from sales pitches. If you need help validating a talk proposal, please reach out for assistance.
- If you experience difficulties with Strapi, please give us the opportunity to address your feedback in advance.
- Make sure to watch this repository to receive updates and join the Community Leader slack channel to stay informed about the latest Strapi news and community activities.


## Embody the Strapi Community Code of Conduct

As Strapi community members we agree to respect the following [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). As a Strapi community leader, it is especially important that you lead by example.  

## Stay informed and aligned with the Strapi team

As a community leader, you’ll have the opportunity to learn and collaborate very closely with the Strapi core team. For instance, we will organize special briefings, workshops or meetings to inform you and get your feedback on upcoming Strapi releases, features, news, and evolutions. In return, we expect community leaders to be both informed and respectful of Strapi’s product development strategy and positioning. 

## Enforcing these Community Guidelines

Strapi reserves the right to remove any member from the Community Leader program for violating these guidelines. In the event of a violation, the Strapi team will review the situation and determine the consequences on a case by case basis.
