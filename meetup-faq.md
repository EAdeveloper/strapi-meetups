### **What should I do if i'm interested in launching a Strapi User Group ?**

Create an issue with the right template in this repository and send an email to hi@strapi.io with the link to the issue you just created. We’ll then create the group on meetup.com (so that you don’t have to pay for the monthly fees) and add you as an organizer. 

### **What are the best practices for launching a Meetup Group ?**

- Attend other Meetups to gain experience and gauge interest in Strapi, Headless CMS and JAMStack.
- Join forces with other Strapi community members, team work makes the dream work!
- Identify and reach out to companies who might be interested in sponsoring or hosting your events
- Check out the calendar to find dates that don’t compete with other meetups
- Pay attention to the Meetup page aesthetics, add logos and pictures, invite members to leave comments and reply to these comments
- Promote the event on social media and invite your peers
- Understand what topics interest your local audience

### **How does Strapi support Meetup organizers?**

- We send you Strapi SWAG (stickers, etc)
- We promote every Meetup on [strapi.io](http://strapi.io) website, the Strapi Weekly newsletter and Social Media
- We connect you with employees or community members interested in speaking at your meetup
- We connect you with companies interested in hosting or sponsoring your meetup

### **Are there any benefits associated with being a Strapi user group leader ?**

We see community leaders as members of the Strapi family. Although there is no direct compensation associated with organizing meetups given the open-source nature of the project, you will definitely get a lot of value out of this program! 

### **How many attendees usually attend Strapi Meetups?**

From 5 to 100 attendees depending on the popularity of Strapi in your city and the date, time and location of your event. 

### **What’s the standard format of a Strapi Meetup?**

Strapi Meetups are usually two or three hours long and usually take place in the evening. That being said, some meetup might take place on the weekend and last longer. We usually have at least 2 different speaker giving 30m talks but the agenda and format is really up to the community leaders who might prefer 10 minutes lightning talks or longer workshops. 

### **What are the first steps after the meetup page is live?**

- Post a message with a link to your new meetup group to relevant groups/pages on social media
- Ping the Strapi team to create a dedicated channel on the community slack
- Look for a company willing to provide the venue for the meetup
- Find a date for the first meetup that does not compete with other groups
- Look for potential speakers living in your city

### **Am I allowed to use the Strapi logo ?**

You are allowed to use the Strapi logo on the meetup group page as long as you respect our [code of conduct.](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) Check out our [media kit](https://strapi.io/press) to choose which versions of the Strapi logo you’d like to use.

### **What happens if I no longer have time to run a Strapi meetup group?**

Although we hope to collaborate with all Community Leaders in the long term, we totally understand it if you have to step down and we'll work together on finding someone else to step up. 

### **Who should I contact to host, sponsor or give a talk at a Strapi meetup?**

We are always looking for meetup venues, sponsor and speaker and very much appreciate any support we can get in brining the Strapi community together. Please send an email to hi@strapi.io or contact directly the Strapi Community Leader on [meetup.com](http://meetup.com)
